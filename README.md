## Introduction

I was approached by a family member to create a website that facilitates the sale of second-hand clothes and various other items. As a strong advocate for eco-friendly initiatives that contribute to a better environment, I saw this as an excellent opportunity to combine my passion for sustainability with my programming skills, particularly in JavaScript and frontend development using React.

This application allowed me to showcase my expertise and creativity while building something meaningful. The process was not only fulfilling but also enjoyable, and I found immense satisfaction in contributing to a platform that promotes sustainable and responsible consumption.

## Features

Responsive Design: Ensure that the website is responsive and can adapt to various screen sizes for a smooth user experience on different devices.
Sorting Mechanism: Add a sorting feature to allow users to arrange the items based on criteria such as price or category.
Card Layout: Implemented a card layout for the items, where users can flip the cards to view more information about the products.
Contact Seller: Provided a contact form for potential buyers to reach out to the seller with inquiries.
Product Details Page: Design a product details page to display comprehensive information about each item, including images, description, measurments, and price.
